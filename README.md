## Purpose
Traditional statistical predictions cannot the meanings axis labels

By leveraging large language models, we can achieve novel statistical predictions accounting for the nuances of the axis labels.

Using labels, you can hand draw a graph about anything, and get a realistic prediction on the outcome of the graph

## How it works?
1. Draw a picture of a graph
2. Snap a picture of it
3. Provide the graph labels
4. Receive a prediction on your data!


## Outcomes
It really works!

The LLM is able to make interesting predictions and discoveries about data that traditional statistical models could never make.

This technology could revolutionize the way that we think about statistical predictions.
